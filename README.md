# fighting-game

### After struggling with Corona in april, I'm back in full force for coding!

This is a fighting game I created from a tutorial from Chris Courses: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqbNFMDRGQ

I added many features, fixed bugs and anomalies and developped a lot my OOP, javascript, DOM manipulation techniques and Canvas knowledge with that project.
